            <b>Albert Einstein German Scientist 14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist, widely acknowledged to be one of the 
                greatest and most influential physicists of all time. Einstein is best known for developing the theory of relativity, but he also made important
               contributions to the development of the theory of quantum mechanics. Relativity and quantum mechanics are the two pillars of modern physics. 
                His mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from relativity theory,has been dubbed "the world's most famous equation". His work is 
                also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to theoretical physics, 
                and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect", a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory. His intellectual
                 achievements and originality resulted in "Einstein" becoming synonymous with "genius". Einsteinium, one of the synthetic elements in the periodic
                  table, was named in his honor.

            After graduating in 1900, Einstein spent almost two years searching for a teaching post. He acquired Swiss citizenship in February 1901, 
            but was not conscripted for medical reasons. With the help of Marcel Grossmann's father, he secured a job in Bern at the Swiss Patent Office,
             as an assistant examiner – level III. Einstein evaluated patent applications for a variety of devices including a gravel sorter and an 
             electromechanical typewriter. In 1903, his position at the Swiss Patent Office became permanent, although he was passed over for promotion
             until he "fully mastered machine technology". Much of his work at the patent office related to questions about transmission of electric signals
             and electrical-mechanical synchronization of time, two technical problems that show up conspicuously in the thought experiments that eventually 
             led Einstein to his radical conclusions about the nature of light and the fundamental connection between space and time.

             With a few friends he had met in Bern, Einstein started a small discussion group in 1902, self-mockingly named "The Olympia Academy", which met
             regularly to discuss science and philosophy. Sometimes they were joined by Mileva who attentively listened but did not participate. Their 
             readings included the works of Henri Poincaré, Ernst Mach, and David Hume, which influenced his scientific and philosophical outlook.
